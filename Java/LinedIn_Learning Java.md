# Learning Java

## 1. Foundations

### 1. Data types

- primitive data types: boolean, int, char, double
- reference types: 
  - String: a sequence of ordered characters 

### 2. String 

- index: charAt(index)

## 2. Classes in Java

### 1. Instance method vs. class method

- Instance methods are often referred to as `non-static` method because you need an instance to use them
- Class methods are often referred to as `static` method because you do not need an instance to use them

### 2. Non-static variable and static variable

- Non-static variables: their values are changed based on the instance
- Static variables: they don't change per instance, they hold a value for the whole class to use. `e.g. the size of the instances in the class`
